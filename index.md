| Join [count] lines, with a minimum of two lines. Remove the indent and insert up to two spaces (see below). | J | M-^ |
| Go to [count] Older cursor position in [jump list](#jumplist) | C-o | C-x C-SPC |

## jumplist

Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you
can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can
move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window. The
maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.

## changelist

When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is
remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a
previous change.
