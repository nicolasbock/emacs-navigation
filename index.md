| Go to [count] newer cursor position in [jump list](#vim-jumplist) | `C-i` | ? |
| Go to [count] older position in [change list](#vim-changelist) | `g;` | ? |

| Unload buffer [N] (default: current buffer) and delete it from the buffer list | `bdelete` | `C-x k` |
| Make all windows (almost) equally high and wide, but use 'winheight' and 'winwidth' for the current window. | `C-W =` | ? |
| Split current window in two.  The result is two viewports on the same file. | `:sp` | `C-x 2` |

## Startup from standard input

Starting vim with `vim -` makes vim read from standard input and then edit. There does not seem to be a way of doing that with Emacs.

# Glossary

## vim changelist

When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is
remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a
previous change.

## vim jumplist

Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you
can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can
move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window. The
maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.

## vim definition of buffers and windows

- A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
- A window is a viewport on a buffer.
- A tab page is a collection of windows.

## vim match motion

Find the next item in this line after or under the cursor and jump to its
match.

Items can be:

- `([{}])`

    parenthesis or (curly/square) brackets
- `/* */`

    start or end of C-style comment
- `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif`

    C preprocessor conditionals (when the cursor is on the # or no ([{
    following)

## vim quickfix list

Vim has a special mode to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  This is
inspired by the quickfix option of the Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga.
The idea is to save the error messages from the compiler in a file and use Vim
to jump to the errors one by one.  You can examine each problem and fix it,
without having to remember all the error messages.
