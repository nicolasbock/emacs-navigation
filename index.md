# Glossary

## changelist

When making a change the cursor position is remembered.  One position is
remembered for every change that can be undone, unless it is close to a
previous change.

## jumplist

Jumps are remembered in a jump list.  With the CTRL-O and CTRL-I command you
can go to cursor positions before older jumps, and back again.  Thus you can
move up and down the list.  There is a separate jump list for each window. The
maximum number of entries is fixed at 100.
